clburlison profiles
===


I'm using submodules to include profiles from other Github users. If you aren't familiar with git submodules use the commands below.

For new clones:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/clburlison/profiles.git
```

To update submodules:
```bash
git pull
git submodule -q foreach git pull -q origin master
```

By including all of these profiles in one place it is much easier to search/find on my computer.

#Disclaimer 
You should read and make sure you understand what each profile is doing prior installing. If you don't know what a key is doing it's your job to look it up.
